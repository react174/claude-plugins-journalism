# Journalism Tools for Claude Code

A plugin marketplace with tools for investigative journalism: Python script execution with automatic dependency management, data preprocessing with provenance tracking, and transparent data analysis designed to be defensible under scrutiny.

## Installation

Add the marketplace and install the plugin:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add nhagar/claude-plugins-journalism
/plugin install journalism-tools@journalism-tools
```

## Skills

Once installed, you'll have access to five skills:

### `/journalism-tools:python-runner`

Run Python scripts with automatic dependency management using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). No manual environment setup required—dependencies are installed automatically in isolated environments.

### `/journalism-tools:journalistic-data-preprocessing`

Preprocessing workflow for journalistic data analysis emphasizing transparency, provenance, and human oversight. Core principles:

- **Provenance first**: Every row traces to source file, sheet, and row number
- **No silent transformations**: Every change is documented and approved
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Present findings and get approval before transformations
- **Transparency artifacts**: Generate documentation suitable for reporters and editors

### `/journalism-tools:structured-data-analysis-journalism`

Analyze preprocessed data for investigative journalism with full transparency. Emphasizes simple, legible analyses over complex methods—every finding must be explainable to editors and defensible under scrutiny. Core principles:

- **Simple beats clever**: Analyses must be explainable in plain language
- **Every number needs a source**: Statistics trace back to verifiable records
- **Findings are hypotheses**: Analysis surfaces patterns, not proof of wrongdoing
- **Defensibility over sophistication**: Simple analyses that hold up under scrutiny

### `/journalism-tools:sports-funding-search`

Search for and compile public subsidies, tax breaks, and government funding for sports teams, stadiums, and venues. Designed for investigative journalists researching public money flowing to sports organizations.

- **Primary sources only**: Every funding figure traces to a budget document, bond filing, tax record, or official agreement
- **Subsidy taxonomy**: Identifies and distinguishes grants, tax abatements, tax-exempt bonds, infrastructure spending, TIF districts, and below-market leases
- **Multi-source research**: Guides search across Good Jobs First, MSRB/EMMA, USA Spending, IRS 990s, and state/local records
- **FOIA targeting**: Identifies specific records to request and tracks outstanding requests
- **Defensible totals**: Requires explicit methodology for any aggregate subsidy figures

### `/journalism-tools:document-extractor`

Extract structured data from documents that resist standard parsing—scanned PDFs, redacted FOIA responses, inconsistent government forms, and OCR artifacts. Follows a five-step workflow:

1. **Convert** documents to page images
2. **Transcribe** each page to markdown, preserving layout and marking redactions, illegible text, and handwriting
3. **Stitch** page transcripts into a single document
4. **Schema** proposal with journalist approval before extraction
5. **Extract** to JSON with provenance tracking and a browser-based review interface

Core principles:

- **Provenance**: Every extracted record traces to source page and document
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Schema must be approved before extraction proceeds
- **Transparent ambiguity**: Redactions, illegible text, and low-confidence values are explicitly marked
- **Zero-install review**: Generates a self-contained HTML interface for journalist verification

## Local Development
